# Tagged

*Tagged* is a small Chrome extension that allows you to manage your bookmarks by using *tags* instead of folders.

It's still a work in progress and **not** ready to be used or even tried.

Actually it is a place for me to learn new technologies. *Tagged* uses:

- [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
- [Angular material](https://material.angularjs.org/)
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Chrome extension itself](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions)

Is a lot of things to tweak. I'll keep this growing on my spare time...
